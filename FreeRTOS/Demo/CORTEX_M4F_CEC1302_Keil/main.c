 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project
 * that demonstrates low power tickless functionality, and a more comprehensive
 * test and demo application.  The configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO setting, which is
 * defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h, is used to select between the two.  The simply
 * blinky low power demo is implemented and described in main_low_power.c.  The
 * more comprehensive test and demo application is implemented and described in
 * main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and standard FreeRTOS hook functions.
